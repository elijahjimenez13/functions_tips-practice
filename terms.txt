1) Decomposition:
Decomposing a program into functions can greatly aid program readability, helping yield an 
initially correct program, and easing future maintenance.

2) Modular Development:
Modular development is the process of dividing a program into  separate modules that can be 
developed and tested separately and then integrated into a single program.

3) Incremental Development:
Incremental development is a process in which a programmer writes and tests a few
statements, then writes and tests a small amount more (an incremental amount), and so
on.

4) Function Stub:
A function stub is a function definition whose statements have not yet been written.

5) Redundant:
Redundant are things that are repeated consistently, for example, functions can help avoiding
redundant statements.
